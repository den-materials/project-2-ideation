# Project 2 Ideation

## Objectives

- Review Project 2 requirements
- Come up with features (models) that are critical to the project
- Create basic [ERDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model) for your project
- Create wireframes (paper prototyping, sketch, illustrator, graph paper, balsamiq, etc) for your project
- Obtain Instructor approval for your project

## Intro

Now that you've had some time to consider APIs and MVC frameworks, it's time to construct a rough plan for your second project. We'll work on getting some firm ideas down on paper, so your project is more manageable.

## Ideation

Create the idea for your project following the steps covered in our UX Crashcourse:

1. What am I making?
2. Why am I making it in the first place?
3. Why would people use it?
4. What kind of people will use it?
5. How do I make it the best resource for them?

Since we're just getting your MVC toolbelt set up, your project isn't required to be as revolutionary as what we brainstormed in the UX Crashcourse - but, you should still follow these basic steps to ensure a quality result.

## Wireframing

Wireframes are low-fidelity sketches of how your app will look and operate - it's the client-facing version of an ERD:

There's a variety of tools you can use to accomplish this:
- Pen and Paper
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
- [Adobe Suite (Photoshop/Illustrator)](http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html)
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

BONUS: If you go the digital route and create someting in Sketch or Adobe, you can prototype even more effectively with [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) and [CRAFT](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft).

## Approval

Once you have the above steps taken care of, your instructors will be available to approve your project!
