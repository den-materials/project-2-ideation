# Ideas

- Review Project 2 again with the class & answer questions
- Ideate ERDs for your project based on project specs (basically just what are the models and how are they connected? nothing fancy)
- Consider features that are critical (models) to be tested
- Perfect your Product Wireframing (paper prototyping, sketch, illustrator, graph paper, balsamiq, etc)
- Instructor approval for your product to create
